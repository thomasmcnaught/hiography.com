As I'm falling asleep and making less sense, I figure I may as well intergrate <a href="https://plausible.io">Plausible Analytics</a> to the site as I'm going to be sending it out on Twitter and Reddit and am curious to know if anyone is interested in a stupid art project I want to explore.</p>
<p>I've opted for Plausible as a privacy-friendly alternative to Google; it doesn't track you, sell your data, or listen to your private conversations so they can conveniently show you where to purchase the product you were just talking about&hellip; even if I do find it handy sometimes because I'm very forgetful. You'll notice I also use <a href="https://protonmail.com">ProtonMail</a> as my email provider instead of Google.</p>
<p>I'll talk more about why your privacy is important some other time, because&mdash;<em>as I said</em>&mdash;I'm falling asleep.</p>
<p>As a quick example though, when I built a <a href="https://totalmindfulness.com">free mindfullness course</a>, I was commited to a <a href="https://totalmindfulness.com/policies/privacy">transparent privacy policy</a> with a tl;dr.</p>
