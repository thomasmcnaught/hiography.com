        <p>Put that Apple Watch down. You do not need to check your heartbeat.</p>
        <p>You agreed to the rules of this site previously. You can't go against the word of the site.</p>
        <p>Eat a Bounty.</p>
        <p>We both like ASMR: you'll disagree, you'll refuse to believe, but you do.</p>
        <p>There's a girl on TikTok who does ASMR, you like her.</p>
        <p>There's also some Scouse drama going on in TikTok world at the moment. You're entraced.</p>
        <p>You've realised that these TikTokers are essentially running a modern-day reality show. They've become sensations utilising their evergrowing popularity: broadcasting themselves live and playing to the same tried-and-tested reality show format you've seen a million times. Is it really such a wild idea that they're actors, just like you've seen before? You still enjoy it, though. You just have a feeling that a production company may be behind all of it. They're all actors, it's all a script.</p>
        <p>I don't know where your ice cream has gone, I'm sorry. All I can advise is that next time we do a shop prior to this so that you have everything you need.</p>
        <p>A <a href="https://www.magnumicecream.com/uk/home.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Magnum</a> Mini has sufficed.</p>
        <p>It's an <a href="https://www.aldi.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="external">ALDI</a> one.</p>
        <p>Sorry, Magnum.</p>
