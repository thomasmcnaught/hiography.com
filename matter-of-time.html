        <p>I saw it coming.<br>The signs were there all along.<br>I just stood and watched.</p>

        <!-- <p>You are sorely missed.</p>

        <p>A cat is distracting me.</p>

        <p>I'm back now. Ready?</p> -->

        <p>It's been a minute. I apologise for that, I've been preoccupied.</p>
        <p>I thought I was fine. I did what they told me to; I got on with it, but it's difficult and I'm no good at smiling when I don't want to.</p>
        <p>I think I froze time and fled my reality. I needed a break. This one destroyed me. I was lost and suffering; in pain every day&hellip; but I have returned. I tried to escape myself, but I'm everywhere.</p>
        <p>I need to focus and remember to just breathe! Fresh air works wonders. My mind is cloudy, but sunlight is breaking through: I can hear the birds. That might not make sense, but it means something to me; that's all that matters. This is therapy. This is my way of healing. This is my eightfold.</p>
