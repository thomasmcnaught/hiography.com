        <p>Something I love about That '70s Show is how from its pilot, it had an in-series expiration date. December 31st, 1979: an unavoidable end.</p>
        <p>You don't get that often. I may be wrong and an uncultured swine, but it seems almost every other TV show has unlimited potential to span decades. As long as people keep watching, they can produce as many episodes as they need, even if it means sacrificing story and dialogue quality.</p>
        <p>The technology world has planned obsolescence, so whatever the equivalent TV term is for a limited lifespan: I'm all for it.</p>
        <p>I think shows with limited exploitable time are so precious.</p>
        <p>I hope grief is the same. I hope these stages don't last forever.</p>
        <p>One of the few things keeping me afloat during this difficult time is writing scripts about my experience. I think trying to view my life right now as a TV show helps me be optimistic that I'll get through it; nobody is watching with such interest that I'll be tortured indefinitely, are they?</p>
        <p>That's why it's crucial I see these projects to completion. Combined, they'll&mdash;<em>optimistically</em>&mdash;mark the end of this epoch.</p>
