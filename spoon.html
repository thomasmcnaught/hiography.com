        <p>On our way up to bed, I swiped a Milky Bar yoghurt out of the fridge and went to get my favourite spoon from the drawer. I was met with shock and confusion.</p>
        <p>I have no idea where this spoon came from, by the way, I only have one of its kind. I adore it.</p>
        <p>The shape, the curves, the weight, everything. It's perfect.</p>
        <p>So where is it?</p>
        <p>This <abbr title="I have no idea if this is how this is used. This cutlery? This item of cutlery? This piece of cutlery? Baldwin, please help. Is it like utensil? You'd say this utensil, not this piece of utensil.">cutlery</abbr> which I cherish is unnaccounted for.</p>
        <p>I can't begin to express the weight of the anxiety that crushed down on me.</p>
        <p>I know, I know&hellip;</p>
        <blockquote><p>&ldquo;Get a grip, it's just a spoon!&rdquo;</p><small>&mdash; you</small></br></br><p>&ldquo;I agree!&rdquo;</p><small>&mdash; me</small></blockquote>
        <p>I know there's so much worse in life. I know it's just a spoon and that logically I can use any spoon in the drawer, but this is where I'm at right now.</p>
        <p>I've had so much taken away from me, I just want to have what I want for a little bit.</p>
        <p>One day your favourite spoon is gone, the next day your dad is.</p>
        <p>Thankfully, I found the spoon. It was in the kitchen sink. Submerged. Isolated.</p>
