Realised I'd pushed this to the website as an .md file, which isn't going to look great in your browser to anyone who's reading this while the project is still in it's infancy. I've updated it to HTML, which was a little trip down memory lane as I was using &lt;i&gt; to italicise instead of &lt;em&gt;... I miss the old days.</p>

This file is now called anhour.</p>

I sent the website to my friend David and realised it wasn't going to look great on his phone, so came back on the laptop to make some adjustments so that he doesn't call me a fucking idiot. By the time he reads this, however, everything will already have been changed. I guess I didn't need to document this one, but it'll be visible on the commits anyway, so may as well be honest.</p>

<p><strong>2021-10-24T04:15</strong><br>I've also decided to rename this back to fourtyfiveminutes, because that's how long it did actually take, the updates since <a href="https://github.com/thomasmcnaught/hiography.com/commit/afc6ddef327abe6ce2439e96ce9ec46598b7786c">afc6dde</a> have been additional tweaks that weren't truly necessary to launch the project.</p>

<p><strong>2021-10-24T04:28</strong><br>I decided to move all of the additional updates to this page, as they're not completely essential to the message of fourtyfiveminutes. I was able to realise an idea within 45 minutes, but I can continue to build on it for as long as I like.</p>
