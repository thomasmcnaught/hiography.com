        <p>I've done a reading of <a href="notetoself">Note to Self</a>, uploaded as a_bedtime_reading.audio.</p>

        <p>There may or may not be that final period on the filename.</p>

        <p>Anyway, all of these encrypted files I'm uploading... if you're actually interested in interacting with them, the decryption password is usually mentioned in the related post. Usually just a word, three words, or an important date.</p>

        <p>That's a super huge giveaway. I've practically taken the challenge away from you.</p>

        <p>I bought two <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08PYN6LWP/"target="_blank" rel=“external”>Ulanzi VL49 RGB</a> lights today. I brought them in to show Hayley and she wanted to take a picture with me lit blue on my left and red on my right. Her phone was capturing it really badly, like some old Photoshop posterised effect, but creepier.</p>

        <p>Thankfully, iPhone 13 Pro to the rescue. AppleRAW captured it perfectly. I've uploaded it unencrypted because I'm fairly pleased with it. You can find the filename though.</p>
