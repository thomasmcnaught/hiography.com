        <p>I bought some <a target="_blank" rel="external" href="https://groceries.asda.com/product/22250">Double Chocolate Cookies</a> from ASDA a few days ago and forgot I'd left one in the bag.</p>
        <p>As I discovered it, my heart grew heavy: it softly crumbled in the palm of my hand.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
          <p>&ldquo;I guess that's the way the cookie crumbles.&rdquo;</p>
          <small>&mdash; me, <em>internally</em></small>
        </blockquote>

        <p><em>Genius.</em></p>

        <p>I thought it was hilarious. I needed to photograph it, give it an arty black and white edit with help from <a target="_blank" rel="external" href="https://reallyniceimages.com/">RNI Films</a>, and share it here and on hiography's social channels, captioned &ldquo;the way,&rdquo; of course.</p>

        <p>Then, the darndest thing happened.</p>
        <p>I fell and stumbled into an alien perspective.</p>
        <p>The view through my camera no longer reflected the reality I'd existed in a few seconds ago.</p>
        <p>I saw sand dunes and mountains. It was cool, peaceful, and beautiful.</p>
        <p>My heart and time froze as I gazed with awe.</p>
        <p>I snapped a couple of shots and sat back up into my reality.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>&ldquo;What the fuck?&rdquo;</p>
          <small>&mdash; me, <em>externally</em></small>
        </blockquote>

        <p>The image data didn't transfer realities correctly. It wasn't <em>quite</em> a worthless pile of protoplasm, but it didn't capture what I saw.</p>

        <p>I tweaked the exposure, brilliance, highlights, shadows, contrast, brightness, black point, saturation, vibrancy, warmth, tint, definition, and vignette, then added a <strong>Fuji Astia 100F</strong> emulation in RNI.</p>

        <p>It's still not <em>quite</em> representative of the world I was momentarily blessed with, but it means a lot to me.</p>
        <p>It means so much to me, in fact, that I posted it to my personal Instagram before even considering how I'd exploit the creativity via hiography.</p>
        <p>Now&mdash;<em>almost 3 hours later</em>&mdash;here I am, writing this bland<sup>[1]</sup> entry, and sharing it on Medium in an attempt to sell out.</p>

        <p>How long until I undeservingly and unnecessarily make it available as a limited edition print? You decide.</p>
